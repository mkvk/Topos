Topos - Web Scraping Assignment

Please run the file "wiki_webscraping.py" which serves as a scraper in python to collect data from "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population" link and associated wiki webpages for each city from the first link.

Requisites : The python environment must have "requests" "BeautifulSoup4" and "pandas" installed. They maybe be installed via "pip install requests BeautifulSoup4 pandas".

Note : Please change the local path in the last line of "wiki_webscraping.py" where you would like to save output CSV file and use "Google Sheets" to view the file.
This output file is tested to upload to BigQuery table and the query result is posted as a snapshot in "Results" folder. The "Results" folder also contains the output file by running the python code and sample visualization of BigQuery Table data on "Google Data Studio".
